Writing points: 

• Different ways of thinking about digital accessibility: 
• It’s not about a person's abilities or impairments, it’s about the design. 
• Disability is caused by a mismatch between the design and the person.

In my previous post I shared how I have interacted with accessible features when using the web. Having closed captioning (CC) on videos where the sound quality was poor was always a lifesaver when trying to understand the content on screen, and helped me to better focus my attention on the dialogue. In the times where I have used accessible features I seldom paid attention to, or had the awareness that this was not standard across the web. 

On a slight tangent, if you’ve ever watched Futurama (bear with me this is going somewhere), there is a quote that you might know in an episode where Bender the robot meets God.
 
After a back and forth where Bender gets frustrated, God says to Bender:

>When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

Now I say all this to say that it's easy to take advantage of good design when it's already present. The true difficulty comes from interacting with disabling design and how ostracising it is when we encounter it. For example, <abbr title = "Closed Captioning"> CC </abbr> 
being unavailable for video content excludes not only people with hearing impairments, but also someone who may be in a noisy environment, or someone who finds it easier to absorb content with <abbr title = "Closed Captioning"> CC </abbr> provided.

Already that is a large and diverse group who for a variety of different reasons, have been unable to partake in the same content as someone who does not have these same concerns. 

The overlap between accessibility needs and general usability needs is far larger than most people realise. What begins as a solution for one specific group inevitably benefits a much broader audience, and it's in this overlap that benefits both consumers and businesses alike. Designing something to be enabling first is a sure way to be inclusive across a variety of needs, and when you’ve done it right feels like it's been there the entire time.
