Not too long ago, I took this picture on a walk home of what I like to call a nursery of lime bikes that were sitting outside of a pub, waiting to be picked up again after whatever sporting event that was showing was finished. I had to stand in the road to take this photo, and even then I still didn't capture the amount that populated the pavement.

Though annoying (and in hindsight quite dangerous), what a perfect visual representation of how pavement users weren’t considered in this bike-share system plan. 

When thinking about web and accessibility and the factors that make a web page accessible, it was comical (and I mean that loosely) to see an example that was offline in such a sheer volume. Especially as I'd only recently been asked “Can something be too accessible?” 

I’d written about how good design takes into account the benefit of one, and how that can be a benefit for all (also known as the curb cut effect). 

Though these bikes represent a good solution for alternative transport, the benefit stops once its aim has been fulfilled. In its aftermath there is now a barrier created for those outside of the intended user group. 

The fault is not in the bike itself, but instead the lack of concessions for those who simply need to access the path; Could there have been designated parking areas that still allowed for clear pathways?

Similar to opting out of providing accessible features in your applications, you inevitably marginalise a whole community of people whose needs may not have been considered in the original target market. 

Arguably designing with accessibility from the start not only increases audience reach, but saves a lot of headache in the future when it will eventually be a requirement.
